# TSS - Technical Service System

Technical Service System, or TSS for short, is a system i designed and programmed for my education as a Analyst-Programmer. It is a .NET web based (but also possible to be used as WPF application) system used to report & manage tasks that would need intervention of a Technical Service. this system is designed to manage the users, tasks, machines and its documenation, suppliers of said machines and contacts of the suppliers. 

i have put it on github so it can potentially grow or help other people with the things they are looking for.
TSS is released under THE GNU GPLv3 and is therefor free to use outside of commercial use.
